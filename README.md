# mano's sorting algorithm
A very basic sorting algorithm written C++ that uses a `buffer` vector where each element of the input vector is inserted into said `buffer` vector at the correct location. This is probably an existing sorting algorithm (see [Insertion Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)), but I made this algorithm without any external resources.
